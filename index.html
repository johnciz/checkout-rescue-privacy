Checkout Rescue AI — Privacy Statement
Phase 16D_1
Last Updated: 2026-01-05 (Australia/Sydney)

===============================================================================
1. PURPOSE
===============================================================================

This Privacy Statement explains how Checkout Rescue AI ("the App", "we", "us")
collects, processes, and protects personal information when providing abandoned
checkout recovery services to Shopify merchants.

This document describes existing system behavior only. It does not introduce
new data practices beyond those already implemented in the application.

===============================================================================
2. ROLE CLARITY (CRITICAL)
===============================================================================

• Merchants are the Data Controller and Sender of Record.
• Checkout Rescue AI acts strictly as a Data Processor and technical pipeline.
• We do not originate marketing or communication decisions.
• We do not determine outreach strategy, content, targeting, or timing.
• All messaging, call logic, thresholds, and enablement are merchant-configured.

Checkout Rescue AI processes data solely on documented merchant instructions.

===============================================================================
3. DATA CATEGORIES PROCESSED
===============================================================================

The App may process the following data, provided by Shopify or the merchant:

Customer identifiers:
• Email address
• Phone number
• Shopify customer ID
• Checkout ID

Checkout metadata:
• Cart contents
• Cart value (AOV)
• Currency
• Timestamps
• Shop domain

Operational metadata:
• Contact attempt status
• Channel used (Email / SMS / Voice)
• Delivery outcomes
• Consent state
• Suppression status
• Audit and policy decisions

No sensitive personal data is intentionally collected.

===============================================================================
4. PURPOSE LIMITATION
===============================================================================

All personal data is processed solely for the following purposes:

• Abandoned checkout recovery
• Compliance enforcement (consent, suppression, quiet hours, billing state)
• Delivery auditing and diagnostics
• Merchant reporting and analytics

Checkout Rescue AI:
• Does not sell personal data
• Does not use data for advertising
• Does not enrich or profile customers
• Does not train general-purpose AI models using merchant data

===============================================================================
5. VOICE AND AI PROCESSING
===============================================================================

When voice recovery is enabled:

• Calls are executed on behalf of the merchant
• The merchant remains the sender of record
• AI behavior is limited to checkout recovery interactions
• Knowledge sources are merchant-supplied (e.g. FAQs, shipping policies)

AI outputs are constrained, auditable, and domain-specific.

Any concierge (human-agent) services operate under separate commercial
agreements and follow the same data protection standards.

===============================================================================
6. DATA RETENTION
===============================================================================

• Data is retained only as long as operationally required
• Retention periods are deterministic and policy-governed
• Audit records are retained for compliance and accountability
• No silent or indefinite retention occurs

Merchants may request deletion or redaction in accordance with GDPR and
applicable privacy laws.

===============================================================================
7. DATA SUBJECT RIGHTS (GDPR & AUSTRALIAN PRIVACY PRINCIPLES)
===============================================================================

The App supports execution of:

• Data access requests
• Data correction
• Data deletion or redaction
• Consent withdrawal
• Suppression enforcement

Merchants are responsible for responding to data subject requests.
Checkout Rescue AI provides tooling to execute those requests safely and
deterministically.

===============================================================================
8. SECURITY SAFEGUARDS
===============================================================================

Security measures include:

• Role-based access control
• Environment isolation
• Provider credential segregation
• Audit logging
• Strict administrative access controls
• Fail-closed enforcement on errors

No customer personal data is intentionally logged in plaintext.

===============================================================================
9. THIRD-PARTY PROCESSORS
===============================================================================

At the merchant’s discretion, the App may integrate with:

• Email service providers
• SMS service providers
• Voice and telephony providers

Only the minimum data required to deliver a message is shared.
Merchants are responsible for contracting and configuring these providers.

===============================================================================
10. DATA LOCATION
===============================================================================

Data may be processed and stored in jurisdictions required to operate the
service and its configured providers. Reasonable safeguards are applied to
protect data regardless of location.

===============================================================================
11. CHILDREN’S DATA
===============================================================================

Checkout Rescue AI is not intended for use with data relating to children.
The App does not knowingly process children’s personal information.

===============================================================================
12. CHANGES
===============================================================================

This Privacy Statement may be updated to reflect legal, regulatory, or product
changes. Material changes will be communicated via the App or the Shopify
App listing.

===============================================================================
13. CONTACT
===============================================================================

For privacy-related questions or requests, merchants may contact the app
operator via the support contact details provided in the Shopify App listing.
